        While it is not possible to select an element based on its state by using pseudo-elements, a pseudo-element can be used to select and style a part of an element that already has a state applied to it. For example, p:hover::first-line selects the first line (pseudo-element) of a paragraph when the paragraph itself is being hovered (pseudo-class).
